At approximately 5:30 AM this morning, I was awakened by loud banging on my door and shouting in the hallway. It turned out that my apartment building was experiencing a major gas leak that had been detected by one of the overnight maintenance staff during routine checks. The fire department was called immediately, and within twenty minutes, they had evacuated our entire building - all 47 units. We were told to leave immediately with only essential items, so I grabbed my phone, wallet, and keys, but unfortunately left my laptop and all my work materials behind. The building remained closed for over eight hours while gas company technicians and fire marshals conducted thorough safety inspections of every unit and the entire building's infrastructure. During this time, I tried my best to work from my phone at a nearby coffee shop, but obviously I couldn't access most of my files or complete the presentation we were supposed to review.

It all started when I woke up at 5 AM to the sound of what I thought was heavy rain, but turned out to be my upstairs neighbor's attempt to create an indoor water feature in their living room. Apparently, they had hired someone from Craigslist to install a 'relaxing fountain,' and this person had somehow connected it to the main water line without properly understanding basic plumbing principles. The result was essentially a geyser in their apartment that was now cascading through my ceiling in what I can only describe as an impromptu indoor waterfall experience. But here's where it gets really interesting: my downstairs neighbor, who is apparently a very heavy sleeper, had left their surround sound system on all night at maximum volume, playing what appears to be a 10-hour loop of whale sounds. The combination of actual falling water and artificial whale songs had created this bizarre sensory experience that I'm pretty sure could be sold as some kind of avant-garde meditation retreat. When the fire department arrived, they stood in my living room for a full five minutes just listening to the whale sounds and watching the water fall before asking if this was some kind of 'intentional art installation.' I had to explain that no, this was just Tuesday morning in my apartment building, but they seemed skeptical until the water pressure finally blew out the upstairs fountain entirely, causing an even more dramatic waterfall effect. The Craigslist installer has apparently disappeared, my upstairs neighbor is mortified and keeps apologizing through the ceiling while trying to contain the flood with beach towels, and my downstairs neighbor finally woke up and is now convinced that the whale sounds somehow summoned an actual marine environment into our building. The water damage restoration team that just arrived says they've seen everything, but this combination of fountain malfunction, surround sound marine life simulation, and confused emergency responders is definitely going in their company newsletter."

I immediately rushed home to discover that what had started as a small kitchen fire had spread rapidly through our older home, and the fire department was working to contain the blaze. My entire family was safely evacuated, but we watched as the fire destroyed most of our belongings, including my computer, all my printed research materials, backup drives, and the presentation materials I had been working on for the past month. We spent yesterday evening dealing with fire investigators, insurance adjusters, and Red Cross volunteers, and were eventually relocated to a temporary hotel room. This morning I woke up hoping to at least attend class and explain the situation, but discovered that all my identification, wallet, and car keys had been destroyed in the fire. Without proper ID, I couldn't check out a laptop from the library, couldn't access my student account from public computers, and couldn't even get my car out of the impound lot where it had been towed during the emergency response. I'm currently waiting for replacement documents from the DMV and working with the Red Cross to establish temporary housing arrangements. I realize this sounds like an elaborate excuse, but I have extensive documentation from the fire department, insurance company, and Red Cross to verify every detail.

Yesterday, I decided to be super responsible and record myself practicing my presentation using my laptop's camera. However, I apparently triggered some kind of motion-detection security feature that I didn't know existed, and now my laptop is convinced that I'm an intruder trying to break into my own dorm room. Every time I try to open my presentation file, my computer starts playing an incredibly loud alarm sound and displaying flashing red lights, while simultaneously sending security alerts to campus safety. I've received seventeen concerned text messages from the RA, twelve automated voicemails from campus security, and one very confused email from IT asking if I'm currently being held against my will by my own computer. The IT help desk says they've never seen this particular malfunction before and they're treating it as a 'learning opportunity.' Meanwhile, I can't access any of my files without triggering what the student next door has started calling 'the disco alarm of academic doom.' The IT team estimates it will take at least another day to convince my laptop that I'm not a security threat to myself.",
            "I'm going to need to miss today's exam because I'm currently involved in what the dean of students has officially categorized as 'an unprecedented campus wildlife situation.' This morning, while I was reviewing my notes on the library steps, a particularly enterprising campus goose decided that my sociology textbook looked like excellent nesting material. When I tried to retrieve my book, the goose apparently interpreted this as an act of war and called in reinforcements. I am now effectively under siege by what the groundskeeping staff estimates to be approximately thirty-seven extremely territorial geese who have collectively decided that I am a threat to their community. Campus security has established a perimeter, but they're currently waiting for the county wildlife specialist to arrive with proper goose negotiation equipment. The situation has attracted a crowd of students who are live-streaming the standoff, and someone has already created a hashtag called #GooseGate2025. The irony is not lost on me that this is happening right before my exam on social conflict theory, but I don't think my professor will appreciate the real-world application I'm currently experiencing. The wildlife specialist estimates that resolution could take several hours, as these particular geese are known to be 'exceptionally stubborn negotiators.'"

            "I need to request a makeup exam for today because I am currently trapped in the most ridiculous academic emergency I could never have imagined possible. It all started yesterday when I decided to be extra prepared and arrived at the library at 6 AM to get some final studying done before today's exam. I found what I thought was the perfect quiet spot on the fourth floor, tucked away in a corner near the old philosophy section where nobody ever goes. What I didn't realize was that this particular corner of the library is apparently home to a family of extremely territorial library cats - which, according to the head librarian I finally managed to contact, aren't supposed to exist because the library has a strict no-pets policy. However, these cats have apparently been living here illegally for several months, sustained by students who have been secretly feeding them and protecting them from library administration. When I sat down in their territory with my textbooks and highlighters, I unknowingly violated some kind of feline academic treaty. The cats initially just glared at me, but when I opened my first textbook, they interpreted the sound of rustling pages as a declaration of war. They began systematically hiding my study materials throughout the library - I've found flash cards wedged between art history books, my calculator inside a philosophy journal, and my lucky exam pen somehow balanced on top of a seven-foot bookshelf. The situation escalated when I tried to retrieve my notes from under a reading table, and the alpha cat decided I was attempting to invade their home base. I am now effectively pinned in this corner while three cats stand guard, occasionally bringing me what I assume are peace offerings in the form of dust bunnies and old library bookmarks. I've been here for over fourteen hours, surviving on vending machine snacks that sympathetic students have passed down to me from the third floor using a complicated pulley system they've constructed from study lamp cords. The library staff discovered my situation this morning, but they're afraid to intervene because they don't want to acknowledge that the cats exist, since that would create a whole administrative nightmare about unauthorized pets in academic buildings. Meanwhile, word has spread among students, and I apparently have become some kind of accidental campus legend. Someone started a social media campaign called 'Free the Exam Student,' and there's now a line of people on the ground floor bringing me supplies and moral support. The philosophy department has apparently declared this an interesting case study in human-animal territorial negotiations, while the sociology professor wants to use my situation as an example of institutional vs. individual power dynamics. I just want to take my exam, but at this point I'm not sure if I'm a student, a hostage, or an unwitting participant in the most elaborate social experiment in university history."

            "I want to sincerely apologize for missing today's family barbecue and provide a full explanation of the circumstances that prevented my attendance. Yesterday evening, while I was doing final preparations and looking forward to seeing everyone, I received an emergency phone call from my college roommate Sarah, whom many of you remember from my graduation. She was calling from a hospital in Denver, where she had been taken by ambulance after collapsing at work. She's currently three months pregnant with her first child, and the doctors were concerned about potential complications that could threaten both her and the baby's health. The reason she called me is that her husband is deployed overseas with the military and won't be able to return for another two weeks, and her own family lives on the East Coast and can't travel immediately due to their own health issues. I'm literally the closest person she has to family in this situation. After talking with her and the medical team, it became clear that she needed someone to advocate for her medical care and provide emotional support during what could be a several-day hospital stay while they monitor her condition and run additional tests. I made the decision to drive to Denver last night to be with her, arriving at the hospital around 3 AM. I've been here ever since, helping her communicate with doctors, contacting her insurance company, arranging for time off from her job, and just being present during what is an incredibly scary time for her. The doctors are cautiously optimistic, but they want to keep her for observation for at least another 48 hours. I know this timing is terrible, and I was genuinely excited about Uncle Mark's famous burger recipe and hearing about everyone's summer plans. I also know that family gatherings are important and that my absence affects the whole dynamic of our get-togethers. Please know that this decision wasn't made lightly, but I couldn't abandon someone who is essentially my sister during such a critical time. I hope everyone understands, and I'm already planning to host a makeup family dinner at my place next month to make up for missing today."

            "I wanted to give you advance notice that I will not be attending this weekend's family gathering, and I want to be completely transparent about my reasons. Over the past several months, I've been working with a therapist to address some personal issues and establish healthier boundaries in various aspects of my life. One of the things we've discussed is my tendency to overcommit myself socially, often at the expense of my own mental health and well-being. This weekend, I have committed to attending a personal development workshop that focuses on stress management and self-care strategies that are directly related to the work I'm doing in therapy. This workshop was scheduled months ago, requires advance payment that is non-refundable, and represents an important step in my ongoing efforts to prioritize my mental health. While I understand that family events are significant and that my absence may be disappointing, I've learned that I need to honor my commitments to my own wellness just as I would honor commitments to other people. This isn't about avoiding family or any interpersonal conflicts - it's about following through on the promises I've made to myself about taking better care of my own needs. I hope you can understand and support this decision, as it represents positive progress in my personal growth. I value our family relationships deeply, and I believe that taking care of my own mental health ultimately makes me a better family member.

Beginning yesterday evening around 6 PM, I started experiencing what I initially dismissed as minor stomach discomfort, assuming it was something I ate for lunch. However, by 9 PM, the discomfort had escalated to severe abdominal cramping accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and increasingly concerning symptoms that made it clear this was not ordinary food sensitivity. By midnight, the pain had become excruciating and was accompanied by fever and severe dehydration from continuous vomiting. My spouse insisted on driving me to the emergency room, where I was immediately triaged and taken for urgent evaluation. The emergency room physician was initially concerned about possible appendicitis, kidney stones, or other serious abdominal emergencies, so I underwent a series of diagnostic tests including blood work, urinalysis, and a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis. The testing process took several hours, during which time I was given IV fluids for dehydration and pain medication to manage the severe cramping. By 4 AM, the test results had ruled out surgical emergencies, and the medical team concluded that I was suffering from severe gastroenteritis, likely caused by bacterial food poisoning from a restaurant meal I had eaten the previous day. While this was a relief compared to the surgical alternatives they had been considering, the severity of my symptoms required continued medical monitoring and treatment. I was kept in the emergency department until 8 AM to ensure my vital signs stabilized and that I could tolerate oral fluids without immediate vomiting. Even after discharge, I was prescribed anti-nausea medication and strict instructions to maintain bed rest and a clear liquid diet for at least 24-48 hours. The attending physician specifically advised against driving or engaging in any activities requiring concentration or physical exertion, as the combination of dehydration, pain medication, and my body's recovery process could impair my judgment and reflexes. I have complete medical documentation from my emergency room visit, including discharge instructions and a physician's note recommending rest for the next 48 hours.

This morning I experienced a severe flare-up of a chronic neurological condition that I manage with medical supervision. The symptoms include debilitating headaches, visual disturbances, and cognitive impairment that make it both unsafe and inadvisable for me to drive or participate meaningfully in any appointments. My neurologist has a specific protocol for managing these episodes, which includes immediate medication, complete rest in a dark environment, and avoiding all unnecessary stimulation or stress. Based on past experience with this condition, I know that attempting to push through these symptoms or ignore the medical management plan typically results in prolonged recovery time and potentially more severe complications.

I have an emergency appointment with my specialist this afternoon, and depending on their assessment, I may need additional testing or treatment modifications that could affect my availability for several days. This is not a routine medical appointment that I can postpone - my medical team has made it clear that ignoring these particular symptoms could lead to serious complications.

            "I am writing to inform you that I must cancel today's appointment and request rescheduling due to a serious medical situation that demands my immediate and complete attention. Over the past 24 hours, I have been experiencing a significant escalation in symptoms related to a chronic autoimmune condition that I have been managing in partnership with a team of specialists for the past several years. What began as minor symptom fluctuations yesterday has progressed to a level of severity that my rheumatologist considers a potential disease flare requiring urgent medical intervention. The specific symptoms I'm experiencing include severe joint inflammation, extreme fatigue that makes concentration difficult, and other systemic effects that would make it impossible for me to participate meaningfully in our scheduled appointment. More critically, my medical team has advised that this type of symptom escalation, if not addressed immediately with aggressive treatment modifications, could lead to permanent joint damage and other serious long-term health consequences. I have an emergency consultation scheduled with my rheumatologist this morning, followed by laboratory work to assess inflammatory markers and determine if my current medication regimen needs significant adjustment. Depending on those results, I may need to begin a different treatment protocol that could require several days of medical monitoring and adjustment. Throughout my experience managing this condition, I have learned that attempting to maintain normal activities during active flares typically prolongs the episode and can lead to more severe complications that impact my health and functionality for weeks or even months. While I understand that appointment cancellations create inconvenience and scheduling challenges, I am confident that addressing this medical crisis promptly and comprehensively will ultimately allow me to return to full engagement with all my commitments more quickly than if I were to push through today and risk a more severe and prolonged health setback. I have comprehensive medical documentation supporting the urgency of this situation and would be happy to provide any necessary verification. I will contact you as soon as my medical team provides clarity on my treatment plan and recovery timeline to reschedule our appointment at the earliest possible opportunity."

My stomach is making sounds that I'm pretty sure violate several noise ordinances, and I've discovered muscles I didn't know existed because they're all cramping in solidarity with my digestive rebellion.

She assured me that I'm not in any danger, but recommended staying close to home facilities and maintaining what she cheerfully called 'a strategic relationship with my bathroom' for the next 24-48 hours.

By evening, I had added a mild cough to the mix, which I attributed to dry air. This morning, I woke up with all of these symptoms plus what appears to be a low-grade fever and general achiness, creating what my physician described as 'a greatest hits album of common cold symptoms.' When I called to ask if I should be concerned, she explained that sometimes our immune systems like to be overachievers and collect multiple minor viral infections like they're trading cards. She said I'm experiencing what she calls 'biological multitasking' - nothing serious, but my body has apparently decided to address several small health issues simultaneously rather than dealing with them one at a time like a normal person. The prescription is rest, fluids, and patience while my immune system finishes whatever organizational project it's currently undertaking.

            "I need to cancel today's medical appointment due to what I can only describe as the most entertainingly ridiculous health situation I have ever experienced in my adult life. It began three days ago when I decided to embrace a healthier lifestyle and started what I thought was a reasonable wellness routine involving morning yoga, meditation, improved nutrition, and better sleep hygiene. However, my body apparently interpreted this sudden influx of healthy behavior as some kind of shock to the system and decided to respond with what my doctor has termed 'an enthusiastic biological adjustment period.' The first sign something was amiss occurred during my second morning yoga session, when I discovered that my flexibility has apparently decreased significantly since college, and several muscles I had forgotten existed began filing formal complaints through the medium of acute soreness. I pushed through this, assuming it was normal adjustment to exercise. The next day, my attempt at meditation was derailed when I realized that sitting quietly for twenty minutes gives my brain an opportunity to catalog every weird sound my body makes, including several that I'm pretty sure are new and concerning. My improved nutrition plan hit a snag when I discovered that my digestive system has apparently become accustomed to processed foods and now treats fresh vegetables like foreign invaders requiring immediate and dramatic expulsion. Meanwhile, my better sleep hygiene routine resulted in me lying awake for hours each night, staring at the ceiling while my body performed what I can only describe as a full systems diagnostic, complete with random muscle twitches, temperature fluctuations, and the kind of restless energy that suggests my nervous system is trying to reorganize itself. By yesterday, I had developed what my doctor calls 'wellness adjustment syndrome,' which is apparently a real thing that happens when you try to improve too many health habits simultaneously. My physician explained that my body is essentially experiencing culture shock from the sudden introduction of healthy behaviors, and she recommended a gradual approach instead of my current 'wellness boot camp' strategy. She also mentioned that my symptoms - which include feeling simultaneously exhausted and wired, confused hunger signals, and what she described as 'metabolic bewilderment' - are actually quite common among people who attempt dramatic lifestyle overhauls. The treatment plan involves slowly reducing my health efforts to a manageable level and allowing my system to adjust gradually, which feels like the most medically ironic prescription I've ever received. I'm currently taking what my doctor calls 'therapeutic moderation' while my body figures out how to process the concept of intentional self-care. My body is essentially having an identity crisis about whether it's healthy or unhealthy, resulting in symptoms that include random energy spikes followed by crashes, digestive confusion that makes meal planning impossible, muscle soreness that migrates around my body like it's exploring new territories, and a sleep schedule that appears to be based on lunar cycles rather than normal human patterns. The doctor assured me this is temporary and even somewhat common, but recommended that I introduce healthy changes more gradually and avoid any additional stress - including medical appointments - while my system recalibrates. She also mentioned that this situation will make an excellent case study for her colleagues about the importance of gradual lifestyle changes, which I suppose makes me feel slightly better about being a cautionary tale about wellness enthusiasm."

I waited patiently behind twelve elderly ladies who were engaged in what I can only describe as competitive flower arranging, complete with heated debates about the emotional significance of different petal arrangements. When I finally reached the counter, the florist informed me that they had just sold their last bouquet to the gardening club, but helpfully suggested I try the grocery store down the street.

This morning started normally, with my usual routine of getting my two children ready for school and myself prepared for work. However, around 10 AM, I received an urgent call from my younger child's school nurse informing me that they had developed a high fever and were feeling quite unwell. The nurse was concerned enough to recommend immediate pickup rather than waiting to see if the symptoms improved throughout the day. When I arrived at school, it was clear that my child was genuinely ill ‚Äì they were pale, lethargic, and running a temperature of 102¬∞F. I immediately took them to their pediatrician, who determined that they likely had contracted a viral infection that's been circulating among children in our area. The doctor advised complete rest for at least 24-48 hours and warned that the fever could spike again, requiring close monitoring. While dealing with my sick child, I also received a call from my older child's middle school about a separate issue involving a conflict with another student that the principal felt needed parental intervention and discussion. The timing couldn't have been worse, as I was trying to juggle caring for one sick child while addressing a behavioral situation with my other child. By the time I had managed both situations, picked up prescribed medication for my younger child, and gotten everyone settled at home, it was well past the time when the school board meeting had begun. I felt it would be disruptive and disrespectful to arrive in the middle of what I knew was going to be a lengthy and important discussion about funding allocations. I want to assure you that my commitment to our children's education remains unwavering, and I will make sure to review all meeting materials and provide my input on the budget proposals through the appropriate channels."

This morning began innocently enough when I decided to start my usual gaming session, but apparently overnight, every piece of technology I own had decided to stage what I can only call a coordinated rebellion.

While waiting for those updates, I tried to test my gaming headset, only to discover that it had somehow forgotten how to connect to any device made after 2019 and was now only compatible with what appears to be vintage radio equipment. My gaming mouse, which has been faithful and reliable for two years, suddenly developed what I can only describe as multiple personality disorder ‚Äì sometimes it clicks when I want it to, sometimes it double-clicks for fun, and occasionally it just decides to move the cursor in random circles like it's trying to hypnotize me.

My teammates initially thought I was performing some kind of avant-garde gaming art piece before they realized I was genuinely trapped in a time loop of delayed reactions.

My absence was due to a series of interconnected family emergencies that began yesterday evening and continued throughout today, creating a situation that required my constant attention and presence. It started when my elderly aunt, who lives alone and had been invited to join our family's holiday gathering, fell in her apartment and was unable to get up. She managed to call me around 10 PM, and when I arrived at her place, it was clear that while she wasn't seriously injured, she had twisted her ankle badly enough that she couldn't walk safely on her own. Since she had no other local family members and was clearly frightened by the incident, I ended up staying overnight to make sure she was comfortable and to help her prepare for today's celebrations. This morning, the situation became more complicated when her regular physician recommended that she be seen at urgent care before participating in any family activities, just to rule out any more serious injury that might not have been apparent initially. The urgent care visit took much longer than expected due to holiday staffing shortages, and by the time we finished with X-rays and paperwork, it was already mid-afternoon. Although my aunt was cleared to participate in limited holiday activities, she was understandably tired and still quite shaken from her fall, so I felt it was important to stay with her through the family dinner to provide support and assistance as needed. While I was disappointed to miss your celebration, I felt that my elderly aunt needed my help and presence more than anyone else that day, and I knew that leaving her alone so soon after her accident would have made me too worried to enjoy the party anyway."

After spending an entire day creating what I can only describe as a mathematical equation involving appetizers, main courses, and desserts from seven different vendors, I thought I had everything under control. Then the decorating committee, which consists of three enthusiastic coworkers with very strong and completely contradictory opinions about holiday aesthetics, decided that our conference room needed to be transformed into what they called 'a winter wonderland that represents everyone's cultural traditions.' This resulted in a decorating scheme that combines Christmas trees, Hanukkah menorahs, Kwanzaa kinara, winter solstice symbols, and what appears to be a small shrine to hot chocolate, all arranged in a pattern that defies both logic and basic principles of interior design.

A situation has developed that requires my immediate and sustained attention, and delaying my response could result in significantly more serious consequences that would be much more difficult to resolve later. This isn't a casual change of plans ‚Äì it's a genuine priority conflict where I need to address an issue that has time-sensitive implications for important aspects of my personal or professional life. I understand that rescheduling creates inconvenience, but I'm confident that addressing this matter promptly will ultimately allow me to be more present and focused when we do meet. I'm committed to finding a replacement meeting time that works well for your schedule, and I'll make sure to block out sufficient time so that our discussion receives the attention it deserves.",

This situation involves commitments and deadlines that were established before our meeting was scheduled, but the timing of the resolution process has moved up significantly due to factors beyond my control. Missing this obligation would have serious implications for ongoing projects and professional relationships that I simply cannot risk. I want to be transparent about the fact that this is a legitimate business priority rather than a casual preference, and I'm prepared to provide whatever flexibility is needed to find a suitable replacement time for our meeting.

This situation involves a matter that I have been monitoring for some time, but recent developments have accelerated the timeline and created an urgent need for my direct involvement and decision-making. The nature of this obligation is such that delaying action beyond today would result in missed opportunities or consequences that could have lasting impact on important aspects of my personal or professional life. This isn't a decision I've made lightly ‚Äì I carefully considered whether the matter could be postponed or handled remotely, but concluded that my physical presence and full attention are essential for achieving the best possible outcome. The timing is particularly unfortunate because I was genuinely looking forward to our meeting and the important discussions we had planned, but I've learned that sometimes competing priorities force difficult choices about how to allocate time and energy most effectively. I want to assure you that this rescheduling doesn't reflect any change in my commitment to our ongoing relationship or the importance I place on the matters we were going to discuss. Rather, it demonstrates my belief that addressing urgent situations promptly and thoroughly ultimately allows for better focus and engagement in all other commitments. I'm prepared to offer significant flexibility in rescheduling and will make sure to allocate adequate time for our discussion when we do meet."

It all started when I woke up to discover that my coffee maker had apparently achieved consciousness overnight and decided that it no longer wanted to make coffee, but rather preferred to make what I can only describe as hot brown water with the emotional depth of dishwater. While attempting to troubleshoot this caffeinated crisis, I managed to somehow trigger a chain reaction that resulted in my smoke detector deciding that the absence of actual smoke was no reason not to practice its emergency protocols at maximum volume. In my frantic attempt to silence the detector, I accidentally knocked over a plant that I didn't even know was capable of shedding this much dirt, creating what now looks like a crime scene investigation site in my kitchen.

My phone, not wanting to be left out of the rebellion, chose this moment to develop what I can only describe as selective connectivity syndrome ‚Äì it can apparently access every social media platform ever invented, but refuses to connect to anything actually useful like email or maps.

This morning's adventure began innocently enough when I decided to be responsible and productive by checking my email before our meeting, only to discover that my computer had apparently spent the night downloading what appears to be every software update that has ever existed since the dawn of computing. While waiting for that technological marathon to complete, I thought I'd use my phone to review our meeting materials, but my phone had mysteriously decided that it no longer recognized my fingerprint, my face, or any of the passwords that I have been using successfully for years. After forty-five minutes of increasingly creative attempts to convince my phone that I am, in fact, its rightful owner, I finally gained access only to find that every single app now requires a new terms of service agreement that apparently needs to be read and accepted individually, creating what feels like a legal document review process that could take several hours to complete. Meanwhile, my laptop finished its update marathon and promptly informed me that all of my saved passwords had been reset for security purposes, effectively locking me out of every account I need to access for work. In desperation, I tried to use my tablet as a backup device, but it had somehow synced with my phone's identity crisis and was now also refusing to recognize me as an authorized user. The situation reached peak absurdity when I attempted to call technical support using my landline, only to discover that my internet-based phone service was now completely non-functional due to what my service provider described as 'an unusual configuration error that our technicians have never seen before.' I'm now sitting in a coffee shop, using their wifi on a borrowed laptop, trying to piece together enough technological functionality to communicate with the outside world and wondering if this is how people felt during the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles."
